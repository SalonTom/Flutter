## 4. Films app<hr/>

As soon as the user opens it, the application displays a list of movies about to be released in theaters. The user can also search for movies by title on the same screen. If they tap on one of the movies, the application will show a second screen, which provides a more detailed view of the movie, including a larger image and a preview. To retrieve the data, the application uses an open web service, which is the Movie Database API.

## 5. Event managers (firebase)<hr/>

It's an event application where the user can view the schedule of an event, including calendar details. All data are hosted remotely, in a Firebase project. The events are stored in a Cloud Firestore database. Once authenticated using Firebase authentication, the user can select their favorite parts of the event by tapping on a star icon. This way, the "favorites" will also be stored remotely.

## 6. Treasure map (firebase)<hr/>

The "Treasure Map" is an application that allows users, after being authenticated via "Firebase Authentication," to mark places on a map, and then add a name, address, and image to them. Photos are taken using the smartphone's camera. Users can view all the locations saved in the "Firebase Cloud" database and the photos in "Firebase Storage," marked on a map or through a list. They can also edit or delete them.
